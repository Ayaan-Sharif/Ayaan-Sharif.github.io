# About Me

Hi! I'm **Ayaan Sharif**, an AI Engineer with hands-on experience in developing and deploying large-scale, multimodal AI systems for video, audio, and text analysis. I'm passionate about leveraging cutting-edge AI technologies, including RAG and agentic workflows, to solve complex real-world problems.

## Professional Summary

I specialize in building and deploying AI systems that can understand and process multiple types of media simultaneously. My work involves processing extensive datasets (12,000+ movies) and implementing high-throughput inference pipelines on cloud infrastructure using A100/L4 GPUs.

Currently working as a **Full Stack AI Engineer** at **Xfinite Global PLC** (erosnow.com), where I develop multimodal AI systems for content analysis and intelligence.
